### Description

This is a starter project for capturing a glimpse of your coding style. In this project, you'll 
work with Star Wars API (SWAPI) and interface with it using GraphQL. 

The requirements are simple. They include rendering a list of information, navigating from and back
to that list, and presenting a web view in a bottom sheet.

For a visual representation of the requirements, please see the "Figma Specifications.png" file
included in this project.

Don't worry, we've given you a head-start by adding Apollo GraphQL, a simple implementation of the
ApolloClient, as well as the only query, `GetPeopleQuery`, you'll be needing for this assignment.

### First step

Please create a branch off of the `development` branch. Then have fun with the assignment.

### GraphQL
